# Assignment – 03  
**Course Title:** Programming Fundamentals  
**Topic:** Implementation of Looping: `FOR` Statement with `break` and `continue`  

---

## Objective  
The objective of this assignment is to learn how to use the `for` loop in C programming and to understand the role of `break` and `continue` statements in controlling loop execution.

## Theory  

Looping is an essential concept in programming that allows repeating a set of instructions multiple times. In C, the most commonly used loop is the **`for` loop**, especially when the number of iterations is known beforehand.  

The `for` loop consists of three parts:  
1. **Initialization** – sets the starting point of the loop variable.  
2. **Condition** – checked before every iteration; the loop runs only if the condition is true.  
3. **Update/Increment** – changes the loop variable after each iteration.  

### Break Statement  
The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop, even if the loop condition is still true. It is useful when we want to stop the loop once a particular condition is met.  

### Continue Statement  
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and jumps directly to the next iteration of the loop. It is used when certain cases need to be ignored without stopping the whole loop.  

Thus, combining `for` loops with `break` and `continue` provides better control over program flow and makes logic implementation easier.
