This is a simple C program that reads a number from the keyboard and checks whether it is **Odd** or **Even**.  
It is written as a class practice example.

---

## Program Logic
1. Take an integer input from the user  
2. Use the modulo operator `%` to check divisibility by 2  
   - If `number % 2 == 0`, the number is **Even**  
   - Otherwise, the number is **Odd**  
3. Print the result

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file named `example3.c`  
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the file location  
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc example3.c -o example3
